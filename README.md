## Introduction
Hi, my name is Adam I am in the "Information Technology: Cybersecurity" and "Information Technology: Computer Programming and Development" (A.A.S.) programs at Wake Tech.
I am focusing more on cybersecurity as that is what I am more passionate about, and I enjoy spending time outside of class learning new things. I have recently taken interest in web designing and everything it entails, such as SEO and digital marketing. I am currently designing a website for a friend and his business right now and handling all of his marketing and outreach. Whenever I am not working or doing school work, I spend my free time in the gym or with friends. I really look forwards to this semester.
